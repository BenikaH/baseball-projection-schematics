# Projection Schematics

One of the most frustrating part of annual baseball projections
is the inconsistency across delivery formats. Spreadsheets come
coded with different player ID systems, character encodings,
and sets of components.

This app allows users to generate schematics to map translations
from native component names (e.g., "mPA" or "DBL") to
whatever you'd like.
