# Projection Schematics

One of the most frustrating part of annual baseball projections
is the inconsistency across delivery formats. Spreadsheets come
coded with different player ID systems, character encodings,
and sets of components.

This app allows users to generate schematics to map translations
from native component names (e.g., "mPA" or "DBL") to
whatever you'd like.

## Schema generation

## Converting with a schematic

## Output formatting

CSV output columns are grouped into sections:

1. Player data (name, age, handedness, team, league, roles)
2. Remote identification (player IDs across MLBAM, Baseball Prospectus, Fangraphs, etc)
3. Component projections (defined by the user)

The ultimate number of columns is determined by the number of components.
